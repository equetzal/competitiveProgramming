The <a href="https://campcarib.wordpress.com">ICPC Caribbean Training Camp</a> It is an annual training camp in Cuba, regularly hosted by the <a href="https://uci.cu">UCI (Universidad de las Ciencias Inform√°ticas / University of Computer Sciences)</a>.

I was fortunate to attend the 12th edition of this camp in 2019, which was led by renowned professor <a href="http://www.algonotes.com/en/author/">Tomasz Idziaszek</a> author of the book [Looking for a Challenge?](http://lookingforachallengethebook.com/)

It was a 2-week camp from March 10 to 14, 2019, attended by about 12 people from the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/algoritmiaescom/">ESCOM-IPN Algorithmic Club</a>.
