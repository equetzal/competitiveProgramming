<h1 id="competitive-programming">Competitive Programming</h1>
<p>It all started in one place:</p>
<center><img src="http://enya.codes/gitassets/competitiveProgramming/logo_huron_circular.png" width="40%"></center>
<p>The ESCOM Algorithmic Club is a group of people that I joined right in the first semester of university. For me they have been a very important club, since I didn’t know anything related to competitive programming, and I had no idea how many things I needed to learn from it.</p>
<p>Thanks to this group, who decided to share their knowledge with me, I met platforms such as Codeforces, Hackerrank, Leetcode, UVa Online Judge, and other online judges that offer excellent training for ICPC (I never knew the IOI and unfortunately I was not able to participate ), nevertheless many projects have been born around competitive programming, and my vision regarding the achievements you can accomplish with programming expanded incredibly. In addition to the knowledge acquired, the fact that you can learn what’s behind the tools most developers use and help in the creation of new technologies of that nature, is an idea that fascinates me.</p>
<h2 id="whats-in-here.">What’s in here.</h2>
<p>In this repository I have decided to upload all the codes I have made for troubleshooting. This includes boot camps, both individual and team practice contests, contest leagues, cups, icpc, or just problems that I have solved throughout my club career.</p>
<p>I also decided to separate this repository from my icpc-reference, because I think the reference should have a more robust structure.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-should-not-do-with-this-repository">What you should NOT do with this repository</h2>
<p>I have created this repository to help keep competitive programming codes organized, but I also decided to make it public so it can be used by someone who needs a code to solve a problem that suits their needs or to learn from an implementation.<br>
In no case do I recommend copying and using these codes for a contest that’s taking place, or in other words, that these codes are used to cheat.<br>
However, the use that you want to give to these codes will depend on the moral of each person, which is why I have licensed it with GPL-3.0</p>
