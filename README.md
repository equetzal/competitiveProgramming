<h1 id="competitive-programming">Competitive Programming</h1>
<p>It all started in one place:</p>
<center><img src="http://enya.codes/gitassets/competitiveProgramming/logo_huron_circular.png" width="40%"></center>
<p>The ESCOM Algorithmic Club. It is a group of people that I entered just in the first semester of university. For me they have been a very important group of people, since I did not know anything related to competitive programming, and I had no idea how many things I needed to learn from it.</p>
<p>Thanks to this group of people who decided to share their knowledge with me, it is that I met platforms such as Codeforces, Hackerrank, Leetcode, UVa Online Judge, and other online judges that offer you excellent training for ICPC (I never knew the IOI and unfortunately I was not able to participate ), nevertheless many projects have been born around the competitive programming, and my vision regarding what you can achieve with the programming expanded incredibly. In addition to knowing everything that is behind the technologies that most developers use and knowing that you can help in the creation of new technologies and tools, it is an idea that fascinates me.</p>
<h2 id="whats-in-here.">Whatâ€™s in here.</h2>
<p>In this repository I have decided to upload all the codes I have made for troubleshooting. This includes boot camps, both individual and team practice contests, contest leagues, cups, icpc, or just problems that I have solved throughout my club career.</p>
<p>I also decided to separate this repository from my icpc-reference, because I think the reference should have a more robust structure.</p>
<h2 id="what-you-should-not-do-with-this-repository">What you should NOT do with this repository</h2>
<p>I have created this repository to help keep competitive programming codes organized, but I also decided to make it public so that if someone needs a code to solve a problem that suits their needs or to learn from an implementation.<br>
In no case do I recommend copying and using these codes for a contest that is taking place, or in other words, that these codes be used to cheat.<br>
However, the use that you want to give to these codes will depend on the moral of each person, which is why I have licensed it with GPL-3.0</p>
